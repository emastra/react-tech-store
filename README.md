# React e-Shop

Modern user interface built on React.js

This project is a dinamic user interface for a standard e-commerce website. It features product filtering and a user cart page.
It is built on React.js and makes use of the Context API to manage the state of the application. It interacts with the browser local storage to retain cart's information also after a page reload or new session. It is designed as modular as possible for future enhancement and components reusabality.
